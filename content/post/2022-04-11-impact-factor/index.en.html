<p><em>Citation counts</em> are critical measures of the influence of an academic work. It is a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics">bibliometrics</a> which use statistical methods to analysis of scientific product.</p>
<p>The Web of Science (WOS) database contains huge and great datasets analysing performance metrics of the journals.<br />
Its user interface has also improved with Clarivate™ and you can find a lot of useful information there.</p>

<p>Here are some performance metrics used by Web of Science.<br />
<br></p>
<div id="impact-factor-if-or-journal-impact-factor-jif" class="section level1">
<h1>Impact Factor (IF) (or Journal Impact Factor = JIF):</h1>
<p>IF reflects the mean citation number in the last two years.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/essays/impact-factor/#:~:text=The%20annual%20JCR%20impact%20factor,years%20(see%20Figure%201).">calculation</a> of Impact Factor (IF) is little bit tricky. And It is published every year, usually in the following year. (2021-IFs will be published in June-2022)</p>
<p>Here is the formula:<br />
<br>
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
     \textbf{IF 2021} = 
     \frac
     {
     \text{Citations in }\textbf{2021}
     \text{ to items published in }{\textbf{2019 &amp; 2020}}
     }
     {
     \text{Citable items} 
     \text{ published in } {\textbf{2019 &amp; 2020}}}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="journal-citation-indicator-jci" class="section level1">
<h1>Journal Citation Indicator (JCI):</h1>
<p>JCI is the average category-normalized impact of citable items published over a recent three year period.</p>
<div id="other-metrics-for-wos" class="section level2">
<h2>Other metrics for WOS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>5-year Impact factor</li>
<li>Eigenfactor Score<br />
</li>
<li>Normalized Eigenfactor<br />
</li>
<li>Article Influence Score<br />

<h1>Some important notes for Academics:</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Impact Factor</strong> is a metric specific to <strong>Web of Science</strong>. (<a href="https://www.scopus.com/sources">Scopus</a> use “Cite score”, <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php">SCImago</a> uses SJR as performance metrics.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Citable items</strong> (denominator of the formula) include only scholarly literature (articles, reviews, and case reports).<br />
NOT non-scholarly literature (editorials, comments, letter, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Citations</strong> (numerator of the formula) include all citations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Onle <strong>SCIE</strong>-indexed and <strong>SSCI</strong>-indexed journals have Impact Factor. <u>AHCI- and ESCI-indexed journals do not have Impact Factor.</u></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ESCI-indexed journals have only JCI, but not Impact Factor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the journals in each category are sorted from highest-to-lowest according to their performance metrics (JIF or JCI), and the list is divided into four groups, the top journal group is defined as first-quartile (<strong>Q1 journals in the category</strong>), the next is Q2, and the next ones Q3, Q4.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Journal IF</strong> and <strong>Journal CI</strong> are different metrics. Therefore, there are 2 definition for quartiles. One is for IF, one for JCI.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because all categories have various number of journals, and some journals belong to more than one category, a journal can be classified in different quartiles (depends on the category).</p>
